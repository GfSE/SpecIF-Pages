## SpecIF Goals

SpecIF stands for "Specification Integration Facility". Process and system descriptions from various sources are brought together in an open format and can be published independently of the authoring tools.

The initiators assume that
- there will always be different tools for the disciplines involved;
- It is not sensible to oblige everyone involved to use a certain tool;
- and that there is nevertheless a high level of interest in reading, searching through and checking the work results of all those involved in a common context.

The following use cases are considered:
<ol>
<li>System engineering collaboration in the supply chain</li>
<ul>
<li>Automotive: „ReqIF for system models with linked requirements“</li>
<li>Aerospace</li>
<li>Utilities: Planning and maintaining renewable energy parks</li>
</ul>
<li>Model exchange between system modeling tools</li>
<ul>
<li>SysML: Enterprise Architect®, Cameo®, Rhapsody® and others</li>
<li>Other notations</li>
</ul>
<li>Integration of models from different notations and tools</li>
<ul>
<li>Navigate, search and audit partial models in a common context</li>
</ul>
</ol>

For this purpose, SpecIF offers a cross-method and cross-manufacturer solution. Existing formats and vocabularies are used as far as possible. The motivation of the GfSE working group PLM4MBSE is summarized in a position paper <a href="http://gfse.de/Dokumente_Mitglieder/ag_ergebnisse/PLM4MBSE/PLM4MBSE_Position_paper_V_1_1.pdf" target="_blank">10 Theses about MBSE and PLM</a>.

Further information can be found on the <a href="https://specif.de" target="_blank">SpecIF homepage</a>, including motivation, examples with online demos and conference papers.

## Setup

SpecIF data can be read with a web browser (preferably Firefox, Chrome or Edge) using the SpecIF viewer or SpecIF editor. In contrast to a document, models in SpecIF format can be easily checked because they do not only contain the model elements, but also their semantic relationships.

### Install the SpecIF Viewer/Editor

#### Install Viewer/Editor on a Web-Server

Download the last released program version “specIF-apps.vX.Y.zip” from <a href="https://github.com/GfSE/SpecIF-Viewer/releases" target="_blank">GfSE/SpecIF-Viewer/releases</a>, to be found in the collapsible “assets” section, and unzip the file in the file system of the web server of your choice. Enter "http://domain.tld/path/view.html" or "http://domain.tld/path/edit.html" in the address line of your web browser to start the respective app. Of course, "domain.tld/path" has to be replaced according to your installation.

#### Use the Installed SpecIF-Viewer/Editor

If the guidelines of your network permit, you can use the <a href="https://apps.specif.de/view.html" target="_blank">SpecIF Viewer</a> or the <a href="https://apps.specif.de/edit.html" target="_blank">SpecIF Model Integrator and Editor</a>, provided for demonstration purposes. You always benefit from the latest release.
