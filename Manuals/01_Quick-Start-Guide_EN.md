# Quick Start Guide

## SpecIF Goals

SpecIF stands for "Specification Integration Facility". Process and system descriptions from various sources are brought together in an open format and can be published independently of the authoring tools.

The initiators assume that
- there will always be different tools for the disciplines involved;
- It is not sensible to oblige everyone involved to use a certain tool;
- and that there is nevertheless a high level of interest in reading, searching through and checking the work results of all those involved in a common context.
The following use cases are considered:
1. System engineering collaboration in the supply chain
    - Automotive: „ReqIF for system models with linked requirements“
    - Aerospace
    - Utilities: Planning and maintaining renewable energy parks
2. Model exchange between system modeling tools
    - SysML: Enterprise Architect®, Cameo®, Rhapsody® and others
    - Other notations
3. Integration of models from different notations and tools
    - Navigate, search and audit partial models in a common context

SpecIF offers a cross-method and cross-manufacturer solution for this purpose. Existing formats and vocabularies are used as far as possible. The motivation of the GfSE working group PLM4MBSE is summarized in a position paper <a href="http://gfse.de/Dokumente_Mitglieder/ag_ergebnisse/PLM4MBSE/PLM4MBSE_Position_paper_V_1_1.pdf" target="_blank">10 Theses about MBSE and PLM</a>.

Further information can be found on the <a href="https://specif.de" target="_blank">SpecIF homepage</a>, including motivation, examples with online demos and conference papers.
