# SpecIF Tutorials

A series of tutorials for the *Specification Integration Facility* (SpecIF). 

The tutorials use the SpecIF v1.0 schema, because the format is easy to understand. It allows a simple JSON structure for simple applications. Alternative, more detailed structures provide additional features such as multi-language texts. SpecIF v1.1 has removed such structural alternatives to simplify the software at the cost of more complicated JSON structure in _all_ cases. The concept of SpecIF is however best explained using the v1.0 schema. At the end of each tutorial there is a link to the SpecIF data in both v1.0 and v1.2.
